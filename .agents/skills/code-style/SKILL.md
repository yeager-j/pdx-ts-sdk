# Code Style

This skill governs how implementation communicates intent at the expression, statement, function,
and file level. 

## Strength

- **Must** identifies code that would mislead its reader or conceal behavior.
- **Default** identifies the clearest choice unless the code provides contrary evidence.
- **Diagnostic** identifies a reason to inspect the code, not an automatic refactor.

## Working method

1. Read the surrounding code and state the behavior the change must preserve or introduce.
2. Write the smallest direct implementation that follows the local idiom.
3. Read the result as its next maintainer. Remove avoidable cleverness, nesting, indirection, and
   explanation debt.
4. Improve code that the change must touch, but do not expand into unrelated cleanup.
5. Use the project's verification requirements; test design is outside this skill.

## 1. Write simple, direct code

Prefer the direct, idiomatic implementation with the fewest concepts a reader must hold at once.
Concise code is not necessarily simple: expand an expression into named steps when understanding it
would otherwise require mental execution, unusual language knowledge, or navigation through extra
indirection. Do not add extensibility for a variation that does not exist.

**Diagnostic:** Understanding an expression requires mentally executing nested callbacks,
conditionals, chains, or a non-obvious language feature. Would named intermediate values make its
sequence and meaning visible?

**Diagnostic:** An abstraction supports configuration, callbacks, or variants for which only one
real use exists. What present requirement earns that flexibility?

## 2. Give names and functions one truthful purpose

Names describe the role a value plays and the behavior a function performs. They must not hide an
effect or claim a narrower result than the code delivers. Prefer domain meaning such as
`eligiblePlanets` and `serializeTrigger` over placeholders such as `filteredItems`, `processData`,
`helper`, or `manager`.

Extract a function when it owns a coherent operation, rule, effect, useful boundary, or consequential
incidental detail. Do not extract merely to reduce line count. Never create a pass-through function
that only forwards arguments or gives a second name to one obvious expression: it adds navigation
without hiding a decision. Keep the expression inline until the function owns meaningful behavior.
Keep each function at one conceptual level: an orchestration function names its steps; the called
functions contain their details.

**Diagnostic:** A function changes purpose, conceptual level, or kind of work while reading it. Does
it contain more than one coherent operation? A function over 100 lines warrants this inspection, but
length alone is not the defect.

**Diagnostic:** A name such as `data`, `item`, `result`, `helper`, or `process` requires reading its
implementation to learn its domain role. What truth could the name carry?

## 3. Keep a pure core inside an explicit impure shell

Pure functions own calculations, decisions, validation, and transformations. An impure shell
coordinates input and output. A function that both calculates a rule and performs an effect has two
jobs; split it.

Pass every variable input to a pure function explicitly. It must not secretly read mutable
configuration, clocks, randomness, environment state, storage, or other external sources. Ordinary
parameters are enough; do not introduce dependency-injection machinery without another reason.

The shell may sequence effects, pass results between operations, and make trivial structural
adaptations. A policy branch or meaningful transformation in the shell is a Diagnostic: extract it
into a pure function so the workflow reads at one level.

```ts
import { readFile, writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import { basename, join } from "node:path";

type Config = { outputDirectory: string };

function calculateOutputPath(filePath: string, config: Config): string {
  return join(config.outputDirectory, basename(filePath));
}

function transformContents(contents: string): string {
  return contents.trim();
}

async function transformFile(filePath: string, config: Config): Promise<void> {
  const contents = await readFile(filePath, "utf8");
  const outputPath = calculateOutputPath(filePath, config);
  const transformedContents = transformContents(contents);

  await writeFile(outputPath, transformedContents);
}
```

**Diagnostic:** Meaningful decisions or transformations are interleaved with side effects, so
testing the rule requires performing or mocking those effects. Can the result be calculated before
the shell applies it?

**Diagnostic:** A function presented as pure reads mutable configuration, the clock, randomness,
environment state, storage, or another variable dependency that is not an argument. Which input
should be explicit?

## 4. Make code explain itself

Code structure and names explain what the program does. Rewrite code instead of adding a comment
that narrates its syntax or compensates for a vague name.

Use an inline comment only for information code cannot carry: rationale, an external constraint, a
protocol or concurrency requirement, a counterintuitive trade-off, or the provenance of a necessary
workaround. A normative comment should become proportionate enforcement when possible.

**Diagnostic:** A comment restates control flow, data flow, or an expression, or compensates for a
vague name. Can the code carry the same information directly?

**Diagnostic:** A workaround or normative comment does not name its cause, constraint, enforcement,
or removal condition. Would a future maintainer know when it is safe to change?

## 5. Document the public surface

Every exported declaration and public member has a concise JSDoc description of its purpose. The
JSDocs should explain what the member is, what it does, and how to use it. Add parameter and
return documentation only when meaning, units, constraints, mutation, or failure
behavior is not evident from the signature. Do not repeat type information in prose.

Add an `@example` when correct use requires non-obvious setup, ordering, composition, callbacks,
structured input, or interpretation of a result. The example must teach something the signature and
description do not.

Do NOT narrativize in the JSDocs. Do NOT explain the inner workings of a function. Do NOT drop
project lore or factoids. The consumer doesn't need to know the member's life story. Treat JSDocs
as public documentation, not a novel.

**Diagnostic:** A consumer must inspect the implementation or tests to learn the member's
constraints, units, mutation, ordering, failure behavior, or required setup. Which part of that
contract belongs in the JSDoc?

**Diagnostic:** A JSDoc repeats names and types or narrates implementation without changing how a
consumer uses the member. What consumer-relevant information does it provide?

## 6. Apply DRY to knowledge, not text

Use DRY in the Hunt and Thomas sense: each piece of knowledge has one authority. Extract code when
copies must change together because they encode the same rule, policy, or invariant. Keep similar
code separate when it represents different concepts that may change independently. There is no
numeric duplication threshold; small duplication is cheaper than false coupling.

**Diagnostic:** The same rule, policy, invariant, mapping, or significant constant is encoded in
several places that must change together. Which place should be its authority?

**Diagnostic:** A shared abstraction has accumulated flags, branches, or caller-specific
terminology to preserve differences between its users. Do those users share knowledge, or only
shape?

## 7. Prefer composition over inheritance

Use composition when collaborators can vary independently. Inheritance is justified only when the
subtype preserves the parent contract and the hierarchy is the simplest model of the relationship.
Never create a base class solely to reuse implementation.

**Diagnostic:** A subclass overrides inherited behavior with a no-op, throws for valid parent
operations, narrows accepted inputs, or exists only to access protected implementation. Does it
preserve the parent contract?

**Diagnostic:** The base class changes repeatedly to support the needs of one subtype. Is that
behavior an independently varying collaborator?

## 8. Keep the happy path linear

Use guard clauses for invalid, absent, exceptional, and already-complete cases so the main operation
remains direct and unindented. Do not invert every conditional mechanically: keep related
alternatives together when their symmetry is clearer as an `if`/`else` or exhaustive dispatch.

**Diagnostic:** The normal successful operation remains nested beneath checks for invalid, absent,
exceptional, or already-complete cases. Would guard clauses expose the main path?

**Diagnostic:** Following the successful path requires tracking several levels of indentation or
repeatedly remembering which earlier conditions remain true. Can the control flow be flattened
without separating symmetric alternatives?

## 9. Decide each distinction once

When the same condition controls several nearby operations, resolve it once into a named value,
selected implementation, or cohesive branch. Engineering Principles governs the larger placement
and modeling decision.

**Diagnostic:** The same predicate or discriminant is checked several times to select related
values, collaborators, or operations. Can the distinction be resolved once into a named result or
cohesive branch?

## Self-review

- Is this the most direct idiomatic implementation, or merely the shortest?
- Does every name tell the truth, and does every function own meaningful behavior?
- Are decisions and transformations pure, with all variable inputs explicit?
- Do inline comments carry information the code cannot, and is the public surface documented?
- Does each abstraction own shared knowledge rather than shared shape?
- Is inheritance genuinely substitutable, or only an implementation-reuse device?
- Is the main path linear, with each distinction resolved once?
